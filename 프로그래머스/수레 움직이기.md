맨처음엔 백트래킹으로 풀었는데. 몇 개 테케 시간초과로 인해 BFS로 변경 

```python
from collections import deque
def solution(maze):
    def bfs(ry, rx, by, bx, r_visit,b_visit,turn):
        q = deque()
        q.append((ry, rx, by, bx,r_visit,b_visit, turn))
        r_visit.add(f'{ry},{rx}')
        b_visit.add(f'{by},{bx}')

        while q:
            ry, rx, by, bx,r_visit,b_visit, turn = q.popleft()
            if maze[ry][rx] == 3 and maze[by][bx] == 4:
